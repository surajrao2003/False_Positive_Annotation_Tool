# False_Positive_Annotation_Tool
The False Positive Annotation Tool allows you to quickly review and manage false positives from a model's predictions. You can accept or reject bounding boxes and edit class labels, all while supporting the COCO dataset format. This tool speeds up manual annotation by enabling you to perform all actions using keyboard shortcuts.
